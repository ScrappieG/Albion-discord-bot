This bot is still being worked on and tested

any questions feel free to reach out to me at stone#3650
----------------------------------------------------------------
This bot uses the murderledger api in order to get info on the
death events of players, specifically the items from the death.
It also uses the albion data project api inorder to get information
from the market about the prices of these items. In general
this is a bot created to help my albion guild with some quality
of life things. People are free to use it however just know that
because it is still in testing their may be some bugs. As well As
there being a lot of things that were specifically designed in the
way my guild members envisioned so you may need to make some changes
where you see fit.
